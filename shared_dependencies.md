Shared Dependencies:

1. **Data**: The raw data collected will be shared across all modules. This can include text data, images, videos, or any other relevant data.

2. **Preprocessed Data**: The preprocessed data will be used in the training module and possibly in the reinforcement learning module.

3. **Trained Model**: The trained AI Bot model will be used in the reinforcement learning, agent creation, and agent deployment modules.

4. **AI Agents**: The AI Agents created will be used in the agent deployment module.

5. **Performance Metrics**: The performance metrics used to evaluate the AI Bot and the AI Agents will be shared across the training, reinforcement learning, and agent deployment modules.

6. **OPENAI API or LLM**: The OPENAI API or LLM will be used across all modules for various tasks like data collection, preprocessing, training, reinforcement learning, agent creation, and agent deployment.

7. **Machine Learning Algorithms**: The machine learning algorithms used for training the AI Bot will be shared across the training and reinforcement learning modules.

8. **Reinforcement Learning Techniques**: The reinforcement learning techniques will be used in the reinforcement learning and agent creation modules.
